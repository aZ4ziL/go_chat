# Go Chat

Finally I managed to make an i chat application in the Golang language.

This project was built with the help of several Golang frameworks including:

1. [GORM ORM SQL FROM GOLANG](https://gorm.io)
2. [Gorilla/Mux Handler](https://github.com/gorilla/mux)
3. [Gorilla Websocket](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket)
4. [Postgresql]()

## How to run

```
git clone https://github.com/aZ4ziL/go_chat.git
cd go_chat

go mod tidy
go run .
```
